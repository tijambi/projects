                  The civil servants go to their various working places every morning not because they want to or
                  because they love their work or because they want to serve, but because of the shame of their financial status.
                  They can't afford to fulfil the list of their family's daily demands. So, they prefer to be in their hiding (working) places.
                  Guess what?... The whole pollution of the republic of South Sudan are on welfare. What a misery?...
                    A nation as desperate as this, is a danger to itself.</p>

                <p class="latestnews" align="justify">A brilliant young woman I know was once asked to support her argument in support of social welfare.
                  She named the most powerful source imaginable. The look in a mother's face when she cannot feed her children, can you look that hungry child in the eyes?...
                  See the blood on his feet from walking barefoot in the corn fields?... Or do you ask her babe sister with a
                  belly swollen of hunger if she cares about her daddy work ethic?</p>

                <p class="latestnews" align="justify">True leader influences others to be their best. Leadership is about social influence, not positional power.
                If you're a slave to the status quo, lack vision, or don't motivate everyone around you to be their absolute best,
                then you're a follower. Even if you happen to have a leadership title, people won't follow you when they see those behaviors present.
                You're not a leader just because you have people reporting to you. And you don't suddenly become a leader once you reach a certain pay grade.<br><br>
                If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.
                You don't even need to have people reporting to you to be a leader. A janitor can influence people and lead just as a CEO can.
                Likewise, anyone can become a follower, even while holding a leadership position</p>
